<h1 class="about-header">About Mike's Site:</h1>
<p class="about-p">This site is games I've progammed and poems I've written. The games are simple, one page, javascript games. 
The poems are Cyber Security inspired.</p>

<p class="about-p">Make sure to check out my GitHub linked above.</p>

<h1 class="about-header">Original Plans for this site:</h1>
<p class="about-p">Originally this site was going to be in PHP with user being able to create accounts with usernames 
and a leaderboard for each game with users high scores. However, due to working full time and not wanting to spend the 
time moderating user generated content, such as inappropriate user names, I opted for a static site instead.</p>
